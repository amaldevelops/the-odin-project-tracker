      <h1>About NodeJs</h1>
      <p>
        NodeJs is an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, Node is
        designed to build scalable network applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        NodeJS (or just ‘Node’) has been steadily gaining popularity since its
        creation in 2009. The internet is flooded with courses and articles
        about it, installing it is a prerequisite for pretty much any front-end
        development work, and of course the amount of jobs that require
        knowledge of it are also on the rise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The important bit to understand right up front is that Node is a
        “JavaScript runtime”. When JavaScript was first created, it was designed
        to run in the browser. This means that it was impossible to use
        JavaScript to write any kind of program that was not a website. Node
        brings JavaScript out of browser-land. This allows developers to use
        JavaScript to accomplish pretty much anything that other popular
        server-side languages such as Ruby, PHP, C# and Python can do. So, at
        its most basic level, Node allows you to run JavaScript code on a
        machine such as your local computer or a server without having to go
        through a web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        To facilitate this, Node has some added functionality that is not found
        in browser-based JavaScript, such as the ability to read and write local
        files, create http connections and listen to network requests.
